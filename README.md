# Bushman Adventures
  
 Developed by : David Rimui

 ## Project Description

This is a test website for a travel agency based in kenya. The website's goal is to show the users details of the destinations and hotels that are in collaboration with the agency. The details should include the destination's and/or hotel's photograph and some of the main attractions. The website should have buttons that direct users to book their hotels and another button where users can book a trip to a destination.The project then ends asking for feedback from the users, presumably those who have been to the zoo.
